# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore

# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line below:
.git
.gitignore

# Reuse the project's gitignore rules (virtualenvs, caches, large artifacts, etc.).
#!include:.gitignore

# Explicitly drop local virtual environments and caches
