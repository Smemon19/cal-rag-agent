TABLE 1507.9.6
WOOD SHAKE MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS
CSSB = Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau.
TFS = Forest Products Laboratory of the Texas Forest Services.
1507.9.7 Attachment. Fasteners for wood shakes shall be
corrosion resistant with a minimum penetration of 3/4 inch
(19.1 mm) into the sheathing. For sheathing less than 1/2
inch (12.7 mm) in thickness, the fasteners shall extend
through the sheathing. Each shake shall be attached with
not fewer than two fasteners.
1507.9.8 Application. Wood shakes shall be laid with a
side lap not less than 11/2 inches (38 mm) between joints in
adjacent courses. Spacing between shakes in the same
course shall be 3/8 to 5/8 inch (9.5 to 15.9 mm) for shakes and
taper sawn shakes of naturally durable wood and shall be 1/4
to 3/8 inch (6.4 to 9.5 mm) for preservative taper sawn
shakes. Weather exposure for wood shakes shall not exceed
those set in Table 1507.9.8.
1507.9.9 Flashing. At the juncture of the roof and vertical
surfaces, flashing and counterflashing shall be provided in
accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions,
and where of metal, shall be not less than 0.019-inch
(0.48 mm) (No. 26 galvanized sheet gage) corrosion-resistant
metal. The valley flashing shall extend not less than
11 inches (279 mm) from the centerline each way and
have a splash diverter rib not less than 1 inch (25 mm)
high at the flow line formed as part of the flashing. Sections
of flashing shall have an end lap of not less than 4
inches (102 mm). For roof slopes of three units vertical in
12 units horizontal (25-percent slope) and over, the valley
flashing shall have a 36-inch-wide (914 mm) underlayment
of either one layer of Type I underlayment running
the full length of the valley or a self-adhering polymer-
modified bitumen sheet bearing a label indicating compliance
with ASTM D1970, in addition to other required
underlayment. In areas where the average daily temperature
in January is 25°F (-4°C) or less or where there is a
possibility of ice forming along the eaves causing a
backup of water, the metal valley flashing underlayment
shall be solidly cemented to the roofing underlayment for
slopes under seven units vertical in 12 units horizontal.

1507.9.10 Label required. Each bundle of shakes shall be
identified by a label of an approved grading or inspection
bureau or agency.
1507.10 Built-up roofs. The installation of built-up roofs
shall comply with the provisions of this section.
1507.10.1 Slope. Built-up roofs shall have a design slope
of not less than one-fourth unit vertical in 12 units horizontal
(2-percent slope) for drainage, except for coal-tar
built-up roofs that shall have a design slope of not less
than one-eighth unit vertical in 12 units horizontal (1-percent
slope).
